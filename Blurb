The Recovered Gems Project
A century ago the likes of P. G. Wodehouse, Agatha Christie, G. K. Chesterton, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Jack London sold stories and serialized novels to popular magazines, works often subsequently reprinted in book form. At the same time equally-brilliant, equally-popular authors were doing likewise; but their names and works are virtually unknown today—one might even say “lost”.

Featuring stories from such magazines an The Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan, Top-Notch, and All-Story Weekly; the Recovered Gems Project is an effort to make these lost works available to the public once more.
